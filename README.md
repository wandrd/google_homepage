ToP/ HTML and CSS intro Proj
Learning the basics of copying a webpage verbatim.  Using the google inspect tool, git, cmd line, and vscode in order to compose and learn.  Excited! 
Will use this same readme to compose my thoughts and give a review of what ive done, learned, the hardest steps along the way, etc...

Things I learned -
- Honestly just getting positioning down and understanding the different ways to position elements was a process. 
- Flexbox saved me multiple times. 
- I grew to understand absolute positioning which helped with the bottom and top nav bars that included links to other pages. 
- The other things I found important was the structuring of div elements to aid with placement of .png files and inputs and buttons.  It felt like i never used enough <divs>
- I need to get better with the float property and understanding the clear property.
- need to practice using css grid and the position property. 
- I tried to use as many different types of css as i could just to aid with practice.  
- But most of all, what a process of trial and error. but I feel way more comfortable.
Cheers!
